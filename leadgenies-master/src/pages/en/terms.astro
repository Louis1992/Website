    <div class="prose prose-invert max-w-none">
      <p class="mb-4">Last updated: January 2026</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">1. Scope of Application</h2>
      <p>
        These General Terms and Conditions (GTC) apply to all business relationships between <strong>LeadGenies Vertriebslösungen GmbH</strong> (hereinafter "Provider") and its customers (hereinafter "Client"). The offer is aimed exclusively at entrepreneurs, legal entities under public law, or special funds under public law within the meaning of § 14 BGB (German Civil Code).
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">2. Subject of Contract</h2>
      <p>
        The subject of the contract is the provision of services in the area of B2B new customer acquisition (cold calling), lead generation, and appointment setting. The Provider acts in the name and on behalf of the Client to contact potential interested parties (leads) according to the agreed target group and to arrange appointments for the Client.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">3. Remuneration and Payment Terms</h2>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">3.1 Prepayment</h3>
      <p>
        Unless otherwise agreed contractually, <strong>prepayment</strong> applies to all services of the Provider. The remuneration is due before the start of the respective service period or before the start of the campaign. The Provider is only obliged to provide the service after full receipt of payment.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">3.2 Late Payment and Refusal of Performance</h3>
      <p>
        If the Client is in default of payment, the Provider is entitled to immediately stop the further execution of the agreed services (right of retention) until the due payment has been made in full. Delays caused by such a service-related pause are the responsibility of the Client; the Provider's claim to remuneration remains unaffected by this.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">4. Zero Appointment Guarantee (Money-Back Guarantee)</h2>
      <p>
        The Provider grants the Client a money-back guarantee for the <strong>first contract month</strong> under the following conditions:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-2">
        <li>
          Should the Provider fail to arrange <strong>at least one (1) appointment</strong> in the first month of cooperation, the Client will be refunded the remuneration paid for this month.
        </li>
        <li>
          An <strong>agreed appointment</strong> within the meaning of this guarantee is defined as any appointment that has been firmly agreed (date and time) with a contact person from the target group defined by the Client or jointly developed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Important:</strong> Only the <strong>arrangement of the appointment</strong> is decisive for the fulfillment of the guarantee. Whether the appointment is actually perceived by the interested party or the Client (e.g., in the case of no-show of the interested party or cancellation after agreement) is irrelevant for the definition as an "agreed appointment". The service of the Provider is considered rendered with the fixing of the appointment date.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">5. Duties of Cooperation of the Client</h2>
      <p>
        The Client undertakes to provide the Provider with all information necessary for the implementation of the campaign (target group definition, value proposition, exclusion criteria, etc.) in good time. Delays caused by a lack of cooperation on the part of the Client shall not be at the expense of the Provider.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">6. Liability</h2>
      <p>
        The Provider is liable without limitation for intent and gross negligence. For simple negligence, the Provider is only liable for the breach of essential contractual obligations (cardinal obligations), the fulfillment of which enables the proper execution of the contract in the first place and on the observance of which the contractual partner may regularly rely. In this case, liability is limited to the foreseeable damage typical for the contract.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">7. Term and Termination</h2>
      <p>
        The contract term and notice periods result from the individual offer or service contract.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">8. Final Provisions</h2>
      <p>
        The law of the Federal Republic of Germany applies. The place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from this contractual relationship is, provided the Client is a merchant, a legal entity under public law, or a special fund under public law, the registered office of the Provider (Seevetal/Lüneburg).
