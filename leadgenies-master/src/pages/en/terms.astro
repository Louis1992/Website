      <p class="mb-4"><strong>General Terms and Conditions (GTC) of LeadGenies Vertriebslösungen GmbH</strong></p>
      <p class="mb-4">Last updated: February 2026</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">1. Scope of Application</h2>
      <p>
        These General Terms and Conditions (GTC) apply to all business relationships between <strong>LeadGenies Vertriebslösungen GmbH</strong> (hereinafter "Provider") and its customers (hereinafter "Client"). The offer is aimed exclusively at entrepreneurs, legal entities under public law, or special funds under public law within the meaning of § 14 BGB (German Civil Code).
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">2. Subject of Contract</h2>
      <p>
        The subject of the contract is the provision of services in the area of B2B new customer acquisition (cold calling), lead generation, and appointment setting. The Provider acts in the name and on behalf of the Client to contact potential interested parties (leads) according to the agreed target group and to arrange appointments for the Client.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">3. Remuneration and Payment Terms</h2>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">3.1 Prepayment</h3>
      <p>
        Unless otherwise agreed contractually, <strong>prepayment</strong> applies to all services of the Provider. The remuneration is due before the start of the respective service period or before the start of the campaign. The Provider is only obliged to provide the service after full receipt of payment.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">3.2 Late Payment and Refusal of Performance</h3>
      <p>
        If the Client is in default of payment, the Provider is entitled to immediately stop the further execution of the agreed services (right of retention) until the due payment has been made in full. Delays caused by such a service-related pause are the responsibility of the Client; the Provider's claim to remuneration remains unaffected by this.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">3.3 Onboarding Fee</h3>
      <p>
        A one-time <strong>onboarding fee</strong> is due in accordance with the individual offer for the initial setup of the campaign, the execution of the ICP workshop, and the familiarization with the Client's specific requirements. This fee covers the Provider's initial effort and is earned and due upon conclusion of the contract. In the event of termination — regardless of the reason — it is non-refundable, as the setup service has already been fully rendered at that point.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">4. Zero Appointment Guarantee (Money-Back Guarantee)</h2>
      <p>
        The Provider grants the Client a money-back guarantee for the <strong>first contract month</strong> under the following conditions:
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Should the Provider fail to arrange <strong>at least one (1) appointment</strong> in the first month of cooperation, the Client will be refunded the remuneration paid for this month.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        An <strong>agreed appointment</strong> within the meaning of this guarantee is defined as any appointment that has been firmly agreed (date and time) with a contact person from the target group defined by the Client or jointly developed.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        <strong>Important:</strong> Only the <strong>arrangement of the appointment</strong> is decisive for the fulfillment of the guarantee. Whether the appointment is actually attended by the interested party or the Client (e.g., in the case of no-show of the interested party or cancellation after the arrangement) is irrelevant for the definition as an "agreed appointment." The Provider's service is considered rendered with the fixing of the appointment.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">5. Duties of Cooperation of the Client</h2>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">5.1</h3>
      <p>
        The Client undertakes to provide the Provider with all information, documents, and access necessary for the implementation of the campaign (e.g., target group definition, value proposition, contact persons, calendar access) in good time and in the agreed format. The Client shall designate a responsible contact person for the duration of the cooperation.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">5.2</h3>
      <p>
        If the Client fails to fulfill or delays in fulfilling its duties of cooperation, any resulting service delays or additional expenses shall be fully borne by the Client. The agreed service period shall not be extended as a result. The Provider's claim to remuneration for the agreed period shall remain in full, even if the agreed services cannot be provided or can only be provided to a limited extent due to the lack of cooperation. The Provider shall notify the Client of the missing cooperation and the resulting consequences.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">6. Liability</h2>
      <p>
        The Provider is liable without limitation for intent and gross negligence. For simple negligence, the Provider is only liable for the breach of essential contractual obligations (cardinal obligations), the fulfillment of which enables the proper execution of the contract in the first place and on the observance of which the contractual partner may regularly rely. In this case, liability is limited to the foreseeable damage typical for the contract.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">7. Term, Termination, and Contract Renewal</h2>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">7.1</h3>
      <p>
        The initial minimum contract term is determined by the individual offer. It begins on the start date specified in the offer.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">7.2</h3>
      <p>
        The contract may be terminated by either party with a notice period of two (2) weeks before the end of the respective contract term. Termination must be in text form (e.g., email).
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">7.3</h3>
      <p>
        If no timely termination is made, the contract shall be automatically renewed for the duration of the original minimum contract term.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2 italic">
        Example: With a minimum term of 3 months, the contract will be renewed for an additional 3 months each time if no termination is received.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">7.4</h3>
      <p>
        The right to extraordinary termination for good cause remains unaffected.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">8. Confidentiality and Data Protection</h2>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">8.1</h3>
      <p>
        Both parties undertake to keep confidential all confidential information of the other party obtained in the course of the cooperation and to use it only for the contractually agreed purposes. This obligation shall continue to apply after termination of the contract.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">8.2</h3>
      <p>
        The Provider processes personal data on behalf of the Client in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If necessary for the provision of services, the parties shall conclude a separate data processing agreement (DPA).
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">9. Force Majeure</h2>
      <p>
        Events of force majeure that materially impede or render impossible the provision of services by a party (e.g., strikes, natural disasters, pandemics, cyber-attacks) shall release the affected party from its performance obligations for the duration of such events. The parties shall inform each other without delay of the occurrence of such an event.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">10. Final Provisions</h2>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">10.1</h3>
      <p>
        The law of the Federal Republic of Germany shall apply, excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG).
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">10.2</h3>
      <p>
        The place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from this contractual relationship is, provided the Client is a merchant, a legal entity under public law, or a special fund under public law, the registered office of the Provider.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">10.3</h3>
      <p>
        Should individual provisions of these GTC be or become invalid, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. In place of the invalid provision, a valid provision shall be deemed agreed that comes closest to the economic purpose of the invalid provision. (Severability clause)
